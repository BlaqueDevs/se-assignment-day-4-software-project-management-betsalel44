1.Timely delivery is crucial to meet client expectations, control costs, and maintain competitiveness. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by setting clear goals, using agile methodologies, monitoring progress, and managing risks proactively.

2.Effective cost control ensures financial stability, maximizes Return on Investment, and keeps the project on track. Strategies to prevent budget overruns include detailed planning, continuous monitoring, scope management, risk assessment, and using cost estimation tools.

3.Agile vs. Waterfall

Agile
Iterative & flexible
High (changes allowed)
Continuous (sprints)
High (constant feedback)  
Lower (early issue detection)

Waterfall
Sequential & structured
Low (changes costly)
Delivered at the end
Low (fixed requirements)
Higher (late-stage issues)

Advantages & Disadvantages

Agile Advantages: Faster feedback, adaptability, better product quality.  
Agile Disadvantages: Requires high collaboration, scope creep risk.

Waterfall Advantages: Clear structure, well-documented, good for stable projects.  
Waterfall Disadvantages: Inflexible, late issue detection, long delivery times.

Best for: Agile = Dynamic projects, startups. Waterfall = Large, well-defined projects.

4. Agile vs. Waterfall: Best Use Cases

Agile is better for:

- Projects with evolving requirements.
- Fast-paced environments needing frequent updates.
- High client involvement.

Examples:

- Mobile app development (e.g., a social media app with changing user needs).
- SaaS products (e.g., cloud-based CRM with regular feature updates).

Waterfall is better for:

- Well-defined, structured projects with fixed scope.
- Compliance-heavy industries requiring thorough documentation.
- Large-scale projects with minimal expected changes.

Examples:

- Construction software (e.g., a system for managing building permits).
- Banking system development (e.g., a secure transaction processing platform).

Agile = Flexibility & speed | Waterfall = Stability & predictability

5. Quality Assurance (QA) Methods

Code Reviews – Catch errors early through peer reviews.  
 Automated Testing – Use unit, integration, and regression tests.  
 Continuous Integration (CI/CD) – Deploy small, tested updates frequently.  
 User Testing – Gather real-world feedback before final release.  
 QA Documentation – Maintain test cases and bug tracking reports.

Why High Standards Matter?  
Reduces bugs & rework – Saves time and cost.  
Ensures security & reliability – Protects users from failures.  
Enhances user experience – Leads to better adoption & satisfaction.  
Maintains brand reputation – Increases trust and credibility.

Bottom line: High-quality software = Happy users & business success!

6- Project Scope & Successful Planning  
Defining the project scope ensures clear objectives, prevents scope creep, and aligns team efforts. It sets boundaries on deliverables, timelines, and resources, leading to better planning and execution.

What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?  
A WBS is a hierarchical breakdown of a project into smaller, manageable tasks. It organizes work into phases, deliverables, and work packages.

Why is WBS Useful?  
 Improves clarity – Defines tasks and responsibilities.  
 Enhances tracking – Helps monitor progress and deadlines.  
 Aids resource allocation – Ensures efficient use of time and budget.  
 Reduces project risks – Identifies potential bottlenecks early.

7-Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule  
Improves time management – Ensures tasks are completed on time.  
Enhances team coordination – Assigns clear responsibilities.  
Identifies dependencies – Helps manage task sequences effectively.  
Prevents delays – Allows early detection of bottlenecks.  
Optimizes resource allocation – Ensures efficient use of people and tools.

##How Gantt Charts Help  
Visual Timeline – Displays tasks, deadlines, and progress.  
Tracks Dependencies – Shows which tasks rely on others.  
Monitors Progress – Keeps stakeholders informed.  
Facilitates Adjustments – Helps reallocate resources if needed.

8- Core Issues My Software Aims to Address  
My software focuses on image and video optimization by recommending the best formats and quality settings for creative projects. It helps users:

Choose the right format – Avoid compatibility issues and maximize quality.  
 Optimize file size – Reduce storage and loading times without losing quality.
